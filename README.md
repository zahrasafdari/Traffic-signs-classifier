The training data for this project leverages a rich resource from Kaggle's 'Traffic Signs - Preprocessed' dataset, created by valentynsichkar (accessable at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed). This dataset provides a wealth of preprocessed traffic sign images, saving valuable time and effort during the initial stages of the project. Notably, the training process focuses on two specific files within the dataset: data0.pickle and data8.pickle. Data0.pickle offers a collection of color images, while data8.pickle contains grayscale versions of the same signs. This dual approach allows the training process to potentially benefit from the advantages of both color and grayscale representations, potentially enhancing the model's ability to recognize traffic signs under various lighting conditions.
